This is a challenging assignment. I didn't quite understand what I was doing so just kinda
mimicked the demo but I know I didn't set up my Main method correctly and need to kinda go 
over that a little more.  It took me about 4 hours to get to the point that it is currently at.
It definitely help going over it in class and tried to type along while it was being code reviewed.
